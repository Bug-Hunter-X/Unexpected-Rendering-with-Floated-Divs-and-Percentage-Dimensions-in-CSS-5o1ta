The following CSS code snippet causes an unexpected rendering issue in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
  background-color: lightblue;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue arises when a `div` element is floated left and has percentage-based width and height values.  Some browsers might interpret the percentage values relative to the parent element's content area, rather than the parent element's total area, leading to incorrect sizing.
