To fix the inconsistent rendering, avoid using percentage-based height for floated elements. A more reliable approach is to use flexbox or grid layout.

Here's an example using flexbox:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  width: 100%;
}

div {
  width: 50%;
  height: 100%; /* Height now works as expected with flexbox */
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

This approach ensures consistent rendering across different browsers because flexbox handles layout and sizing more predictably than the float property when dealing with percentage dimensions.
